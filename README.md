# wind_variability
Exploration of wind variability across the U.S. using SQL and Google BigQuery. Conducted as a final project for CS145: Data Management and Data Systems, so results should be taken lightly.
With Google's free monthly computing credit, anyone should be able to run the ipython notebook after setting up an account. Otherwise, I include a pdf of the code including the output (plots, tables, etc.).
