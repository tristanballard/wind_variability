# wind_variability
Exploration of factors driving global wind variability using SQL and Google BigQuery. Conducted as a final project for CS145: Data Management and Data Systems, so results should be taken lightly.
With Google's free monthly computing credit, anyone should be able to run the ipython notebook after setting up an account and inserting the appropriate project_id. Otherwise, I include a pdf of the code including the output (plots, tables, etc.).
